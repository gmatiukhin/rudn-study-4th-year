abstract = {In this paper we consider a multi agent planning problem where given a set of plans of the individual agents that may lead to conflict during execution, the task is to find a conflict-free plan for the agents. For this we give a formal model of the multi agent planning problem (MAPP) and give a description of the multi agent path planning. We demonstrate this technique in a grid world domain. The experimental results show promise for our method.}
