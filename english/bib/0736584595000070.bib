abstract = {This paper addresses a multi-agent architecture for dynamic scheduling. The flexibility of the architecture both from the organizational point of view and from the control one is supported by the negotiation technique. The need for integration, the use of standards and information modelling are emphasized. Combining a distributed architecture with an integration of the scheduling and control functionalities flexibility is increased, especially when disruptions take place. Finally, some conclusions and implementation aspects are presented.}
