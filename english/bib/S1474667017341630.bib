abstract = {In this paper we will discuss about a problematical using multi-agent system (MAS) for resolving the problem scheduhng production. The basic idea for achieving global optimal solution is a coordinating all agents to resolve (in our case each producer is considered as one autonomous agent). Each agent possesses own goal but it can Improve own goal by coordinating with another or help another one to achieve its goal. We will analyze what may bnng the coordmatlon between agents and propose several mechanisms for coordination. Also we will discuss about a methods of evaluating bid that the agents order between themselves}
