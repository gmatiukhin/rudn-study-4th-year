abstract = {This paper argues that AI planning is a technology ripe for use on real world problems as shown by a number of current applications. An introduction is given to AI planning, and then followed by discussion of the successful application of this technology to generating operating procedures for chemical plants. A description is given of the methodology for developing planning domains and finally the results of its application to operating procedure synthesis are discussed.}
