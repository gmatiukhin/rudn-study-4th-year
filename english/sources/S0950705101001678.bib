abstract = {There is a variety of applications that can benefit from the ability to find optimal or good solutions to a proposed problem, automatically. The artificial intelligent (AI) community has been actively involved in efficient problem-solving in complex domains such as military or spacecraft problems with successful results. In this paper, we describe the integration of AI planning techniques with an existing workflow management system. We show how these techniques can improve the overall system functionality and help automate the definition of business processes. The work is based on a short study carried out at BT research laboratories as part of a larger programme that aims to provide technologies for a new generation of business support systems.}
